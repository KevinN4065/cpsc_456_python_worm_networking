# cpsc_456_python_worm_networking

* A worm malware to infect other computers on the same network (ONLY ATTEMPT THIS ON A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DUMB DECISIONS) 

* Executing the program will look through the hosts on the virutal environment and try to spread and execute itself there with an infected.txt file

# Version

* Python: 2.X (Following the lubuntu provided in cpsc-456)

# Execution 

* Type in the command terminal -> "python worm.py"

# For Group Members 

* Code should mostly be complete but still a few minor bugs left. 

* Code has enough comments to give you the general idea of what's going 

* and some of the functions follow the two files that were provided apart from worm.py to clarify some things
